If you get an error when you do database migration, during the deployment process:
{% codeblock %}$ heroku rake db:migrate
rake aborted!
Please install the postgresql adapter: `gem install activerecord-postgresql-adapter` (pg is not part of the bundle. Add it to Gemfile.)Tasks: TOP =&gt; db:migrate =&gt; db:load_config
(See full trace by running task with --trace){% endcodeblock %}
Add PostgreSQL gem, replace the line <strong><em>gem 'sqlite3'</em></strong> with:
{% codeblock %}group :development, :test do
  gem 'sqlite3'
end
group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end{% endcodeblock %}
This ensures the production using PostgreSQL, since Heroku does not support sqlite3.

<del>If after success deployed the rail app, the application gives an error page like: “We're sorry, but something went wrong...” This is actually a generic error message. It might be caused by the assets loading problem. I did forget to compile the assets before deploy the app.</del>

<del>Run the following command before deployment to compile the assets to <em><strong>public/</strong></em> directory

</del>
{% codeblock %}<del>bundle exec rake assets:precompile</del>{% endcodeblock %}
Then do the deployment again:
{% codeblock %}git push heroku master{% endcodeblock %}
