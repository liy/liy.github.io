Regarding the "<a title="Spork" href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#sec:spork" target="_blank">Spork</a>" in the RoR tutorial... Do not use it!!

In the section author mentioned:
<blockquote>...Spork prefork loading, which can sometimes prevent necessary files from being re-loaded...</blockquote>
The autotest will no longer be reliable if you try to use spork.
