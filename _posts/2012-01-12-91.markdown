I have Xcode installed already, which puts an older version of git in: <strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong>

Homebrew install newer version of git at: <strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong>

We have to mannally change <strong>$PATH</strong> variable to ensure the <strong>/user/local/bin</strong> comes before <strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong>

By the way, the <strong>$PATH</strong> environment variable is loaded from this file: <strong>/etc/paths</strong>
